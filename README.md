## **Project Overview**
The **Campus Lost & Found App** is designed to help the school community easily report and recover lost items.  
This app replaces traditional methods like Facebook posts or word of mouth, which can be inefficient and unreliable.  

With this app, students, teachers, and staff can quickly report lost or found items, upload photos, and browse through reports to recover items efficiently.  

---

## **Features**
- **User Login & Registration** – Secure access for all campus members.  
- **Report Lost or Found Items** – Fill out a simple form with item details and upload a photo.  
- **Search & Filter Reports** – Quickly find reported items.  
- **Update Item Status** – Mark items as returned when recovered.  
- **Contact Information** – Each report includes contact info of the finder for safe handover.  

---

## **Problem Statement**
Currently, lost items are reported through social media or by word of mouth. This leads to:
- Posts getting buried or overlooked  
- No official records of lost items  
- Low recovery rates  

The app provides a **campus-exclusive platform** that organizes lost and found reports and increases the likelihood of items being returned.  

---

## **Objectives**
- Centralize lost & found reports in one platform  
- Improve the recovery rate of lost items  
- Save time for both owners and finders  
- Promote trust and accountability in the campus community  

---

## **Scope**
- User login and registration  
- Posting lost/found items with photos and descriptions  
- Searching and filtering reports  
- Updating item status once items are returned  

---

## **Limitations**
- Only for use within the campus  
- Does not include GPS tracking  
- Relies on users providing accurate information  

---

## **How It Works**
1. Users register or log in.  
2. Report lost or found items with a photo and description.  
3. Browse or search for items reported by others.  
4. Contact the finder/owner to arrange a safe meet-up for returning items.
